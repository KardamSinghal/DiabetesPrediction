# 🧪 Diabetes Prediction

A machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health metrics. This model supports early detection and preventive care by analyzing key medical indicators.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a diabetes prediction system. The model is trained on a dataset with features commonly associated with diabetes risk and classifies whether a patient is likely to have diabetes.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## 📊 Dataset Features

Typical features used in diabetes prediction include:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

> Ensure proper preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and scaling features before training.

## 🧠 Model Training

The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, or Random Forest
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## 📈 Results

The trained model demonstrates strong performance on test data, with visualizations to support interpretability and insights into feature importance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KardamSinghal/DiabetesPrediction.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   cd DiabetesPrediction
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to follow the workflow.
